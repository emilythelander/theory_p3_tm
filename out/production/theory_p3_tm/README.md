# Compiling/Running:

Navigate to the project root directory, i.e. the directory containing folders tm, test, etc. 

Compile the project using the command `javac */*.java`

To run the project, add your test file(s) to the test directory. The driver file is TMSimulator.java, and the command line arg is the name of the file (not the path). For example, if your test file is located at test/file1.txt, you should run the command `java tm.TMSimulator file1.txt`
