# Compiling/Running:

Navigate to the project root directory, i.e. the directory containing the tm folder.

Compile the project using the command `javac */*.java`

To run the project, add your input file(s) to the tm directory. The driver file is TMSimulator.java, and the command line arg is the name of the file (not the path). For example, if your input file is located at tm/file1.txt, you should run the command `java tm.TMSimulator file1.txt`
